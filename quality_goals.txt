Testing:

Everything should be unit tested, and it should be possible to run tests for
all parts at once, with combined report of results, and coverage

Documentation:

thorough docstrings everywhere, design decisions and architecture
covered in documentation pdf

Performance:

initial loading of blocks to mongo should be under 24h,
it would be great if it would proceed in 10h, but now I suspect it to run for
about 100h
